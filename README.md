### Notable Projects:
- **[AirCinelMVC](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/AirCinelMVC)**: A comprehensive airline management system built with ASP.NET Core MVC, featuring seat selection, role-based access control, and flight management. The project is designed with key patterns like Dependency Injection and Repository to enhance maintainability and scalability. It uses SQL Server with Entity Framework for database interactions and integrates with Azure for web app deployment and blob storage management.

- **[AirCinelMAUI](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/AirCinelMAUI)**: A cross-platform mobile application built with .NET MAUI, designed to complement the AirCinelMVC project. The app provides a seamless flight booking experience, including flight browsing, seat selection, ticket purchase, profile management, and flight history. It integrates with the AirCinelMVC API for authentication and data handling, leveraging Azure Blob Storage for image management. Built with the MVVM pattern, the app ensures maintainability, scalability, and a clean separation of concerns. [Watch Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjx-Wo-3Io).

- **[FitSharp](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/FitSharp)**: An all-in-one gym management solution built with ASP.NET MVC (.NET 5). It streamlines operations for administrators, staff, instructors, and customers by offering features such as user registration, class booking, personalized recommendations, and role-based access control. The project leverages technologies like Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, Bootstrap 4, and Azure Blob Storage, alongside libraries like Syncfusion and FullCalendar, to deliver a scalable and user-friendly platform tailored for gym networks.

- **[FitSharpMAUI](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/FitSharpMaui)**: A cross-platform mobile application built with .NET MAUI, designed to complement the FitSharp gym management system. It allows users to manage their gym interactions on the go, including class bookings, membership management, profile updates, and instructor reviews. The app integrates seamlessly with the FitSharp backend via APIs, ensuring real-time data synchronization and a responsive user experience. Technologies used include .NET MAUI, and Azure Blob Storage.

- **[letsDonate](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/letsDonate)**: One of my earliest projects, developed during the CS50x course. This donation platform, built with Flask, encourages giving unused items a second life by connecting them with those in need. It includes features such as user registration, item listing, contact information sharing, and donation management. This project laid the foundation for my skills in Python and web development frameworks. [Watch Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o347l4wsz5U).

- **[Employee Management](https://github.com/SalavessaMota/EmployeeManagement)**: A Python-based employee management system, developed during the CS50P course, using SQLite3 for data storage and a command-line interface. It provides functionalities like adding, updating, and removing employee records, listing all employees, and generating PDF reports. This project built on my prior experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of database operations and Python's versatility. [Watch Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDYLokSWBA0).
